# victory-kickstart

My goal is to have this repo contain a bunch of different charts that I can refer back to.

## TODO

- Add tooltip to each bar on hover.
- Add label to total threes chart.
- Add legend to stack chart.
- Animate data changes.
- Pull all style objects into a separate styles file.


## Installation

Just fork and clone this repo, run `npm install`, then `npm run start`. Then go to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser.
